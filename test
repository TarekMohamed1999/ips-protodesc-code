In 1981,
^

'Text' object has no attribute 'strip'

was released, documenting the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), and replacing earlier specifications for TCP that had been published in the past.
^
Parse error at line 2, column 0: expected one of end of input, token 'A ', or token 'An '. trail: [preamble]


Since then, TCP has been widely implemented, and has been used as a transport protocol for numerous applications on the Internet.

Parse error at line 2, column 0: expected one of end of input, token 'A ', or token 'An '. trail: [preamble]


For several decades, RFC 793 plus a number of other documents have combined to serve as the core specification for TCP
^
Parse error at line 2, column 0: expected one of end of input, token 'A ', or token 'An '. trail: [preamble]

'NoneType' object has no attribute 'strip'

.  Over time, a number of errata have been filed against RFC 793, as well as deficiencies in security, performance, and many other aspects.  The number of enhancements has grown over time across many separate documents.  These were never accumulated together into a comprehensive update to the base specification.
^
Parse error at line 2, column 0: expected one of end of input, token 'A ', or token 'An '. trail: [preamble]


The purpose of this document is to bring together all of the IETF Standards Track changes that have been made to the base TCP functional specification and unify them into an update of RFC 793.
^
Parse error at line 2, column 0: expected one of end of input, token 'A ', or token 'An '. trail: [preamble]


Some companion documents are referenced for important algorithms that are used by TCP (e.g. for congestion control), but have not been completely included in this document.  This is a conscious choice, as this base specification can be used with multiple additional algorithms that are developed and incorporated separately. This document focuses on the common basis all TCP implementations must support in order to interoperate.  Since some additional TCP features have become quite complicated themselves (e.g. advanced loss recovery and congestion control), future companion documents may attempt to similarly bring these together.

In addition to the protocol specification that describes the TCP segment format, generation, and processing rules that are to be implemented in code, RFC 793 and other updates also contain informative and descriptive text for readers to understand aspects of the protocol design and operation.  This document does not attempt to alter or update this informative text, and is focused only on updating the normative protocol specification.  This document preserves references to the documentation containing the important explanations and rationale, where appropriate.

This document is intended to be useful both in checking existing TCP implementations for conformance purposes, as well as in writing new implementations.

RFC 793 contains a discussion of the TCP design goals and provides examples of its operation, including examples of connection establishment, connection termination, packet retransmission to repair losses.

This document describes the basic functionality expected in modern TCP implementations, and replaces the protocol specification in RFC 793.  It does not replicate or attempt to update the introduction and philosophy content in Sections 1 and 2 of RFC 793.  Other documents are referenced to provide explanation of the theory of operation, rationale, and detailed discussion of design decisions.  This document only focuses on the normative behavior of the protocol.

The term "segmentation" refers to the activity TCP performs when ingesting a stream of bytes from a sending application and packetizing that stream of bytes into TCP segments.  Individual TCP segments often do not correspond one-for-one to individual send (or socket write) calls from the application.  Applications may perform writes at the granularity of messages in the upper layer protocol, but TCP guarantees no boundary coherence between the TCP segments sent and received versus user application data read or write buffer boundaries.  In some specific protocols, such as Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) using Direct Data Placement (DDP) and Marker PDU Aligned Framing (MPA)
^
Parse error at line 2, column 0: expected one of end of input, token 'A ', or token 'An '. trail: [preamble]

'NoneType' object has no attribute 'strip'

, there are performance optimizations possible when the relation between TCP segments and application data units can be controlled, and MPA includes a specific mechanism for detecting and verifying this relationship between TCP segments and application message data structures, but this is specific to applications like RDMA.  In general, multiple goals influence the sizing of TCP segments created by a TCP implementation.
^

Goals driving the sending of larger segments include:

'list' object has no attribute 'strip'


^
Parse error at line 2, column 0: expected one of end of input, token 'A ', or token 'An '. trail: [preamble]


Note that the performance benefits of sending larger segments may decrease as the size increases, and there may be boundaries where advantages are reversed.  For instance, on some implementation architectures, 1025 bytes within a segment could lead to worse performance than 1024 bytes, due purely to data alignment on copy operations.

A TCP implementation may be aware of the MTU on directly connected links, but will rarely have insight about MTUs across an entire network path.  For IPv4, RFC 1122 recommends an IP-layer default effective MTU of less than or equal to 576 for destinations not directly connected.  For IPv6, this would be 1280.  In all cases, however, implementation of Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) and Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery (PLPMTUD) is strongly recommended in order for TCP to improve segmentation decisions.  Both PMTUD and PLPMTUD help TCP choose segment sizes that avoid both on-path (for IPv4) and source fragmentation (IPv4 and IPv6).
                                                                        ^

is implemented in conjunction between TCP, IP, and ICMP protocols.  It relies both on avoiding source fragmentation and setting the IPv4 DF (don't fragment) flag, the latter to inhibit on-path fragmentation.  It relies on ICMP errors from routers along the path, whenever a segment is too large to traverse a link.  Several adjustments to a TCP implementation with PMTUD are described in RFC 2923 in order to deal with problems experienced in practice

RFC 2581 provided IETF Standards Track description of slow start and congestion avoidance, along with fast retransmit and fast recovery.  RFC 5681 is the current description of these algorithms and is the current Standards Track specification providing guidelines for TCP congestion control.

RFC 5681 and RFC 6298 describe the basic algorithms on the IETF Standards Track that are broadly applicable.  Multiple other suitable algorithms exist and have been widely used.  Many TCP implementations support a set of alternative algorithms that can be configured for use on the endpoint.  An endpoint may implement such alternative algorithms provided that the algorithms are conformant with the TCP specifications from the IETF Standards Track as described in RFC 2914, RFC 5033

The "Silly Window Syndrome" (SWS) is a stable pattern of small incremental window movements resulting in extremely poor TCP performance.  Algorithms to avoid SWS are described below for both the sending side and the receiving side.  RFC 1122 contains more detailed discussion of the SWS problem.  Note that the Nagle algorithm and the sender SWS avoidance algorithm play complementary roles in improving performance.  The Nagle algorithm discourages sending tiny segments when the data to be sent increases in small increments, while the SWS avoidance algorithm discourages small segments resulting from the right window edge advancing in small increments.

This document obsoletes RFC 793 as well as RFC 6093 and 6528, which updated 793.  In all cases, only the normative protocol specification and requirements have been incorporated into this document, and some informational text with background and rationale may not have been carried in.  The informational content of those documents is still valuable in learning about and understanding TCP, and they are valid Informational references, even though their normative content has been incorporated into this document.

This document started as draft-eddy-rfc793bis-00, that was merely a proposal and rough plan for updating RFC 793.
^
Parse error at line 2, column 0: expected one of end of input, token 'A ', or token 'An '. trail: [preamble]


The -01 revision of this draft-eddy-rfc793bis incorporates the content of RFC 793 Section 3 titled "FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATION".  Other content from RFC 793 has not been incorporated.  The -01 revision of this document makes some minor formatting changes to the RFC 793 content in order to convert the content into XML2RFC format and account for left-out parts of RFC 793.  For instance, figure numbering differs and some indentation is not exactly the same.

The TCP design includes only rudimentary security features that improve the robustness and reliability of connections and application data transfer, but there are no built-in cryptographic capabilities to support any form of privacy, authentication, or other typical security functions.  Non-cryptographic enhancements (e.g.

) have been developed to improve robustness of TCP connections to particular types of attacks, but the applicability and protections of non-cryptographic enhancements are limited (e.g. see section 1.1 of

Applications typically utilize lower-layer (e.g. IPsec) and upper-layer (e.g. TLS) protocols to provide security and privacy for TCP connections and application data carried in TCP.  Methods based on TCP options have been developed as well, to support some security capabilities.

.  TCP-MD5 was a commonly implemented TCP option to support authentication for some of these connections, but had flaws and is now deprecated.  TCP-AO provides a capability to protect long-lived TCP connections from attacks, and has superior properties to TCP-MD5.  It does not provide any privacy for application data, nor for the TCP headers.

Since TCP is often used for bulk transfer flows, some attacks are possible that abuse the TCP congestion control logic.  An example is "ACK-division" attacks. Updates that have been made to the TCP congestion control specifications include mechanisms like Appropriate Byte Counting (ABC)
