   The sender report packet consists of three sections, possibly
   followed by a fourth profile-specific extension section if defined.
   The first section, the header, is 8 octets long.  The fields have the
   following meaning:

   version (V): 2 bits

      Identifies the version of RTP, which is the same in RTCP packets
      as in RTP data packets.  The version defined by this specification
      is two (2).

   padding (P): 1 bit

      If the padding bit is set, this individual RTCP packet contains
      some additional padding octets at the end which are not part of
      the control information but are included in the length field.  The
      last octet of the padding is a count of how many padding octets
      should be ignored, including itself (it will be a multiple of
      four).  Padding may be needed by some encryption algorithms with
      fixed block sizes.  In a compound RTCP packet, padding is only
      required on one individual packet because the compound packet is
      encrypted as a whole for the method in Section 9.1.  Thus, padding
      MUST only be added to the last individual packet, and if padding
      is added to that packet, the padding bit MUST be set only on that
      packet.  This convention aids the header validity checks described
      in Appendix A.2 and allows detection of packets from some early
      implementations that incorrectly set the padding bit on the first
      individual packet and add padding to the last individual packet.

   reception report count (RC): 5 bits

      The number of reception report blocks contained in this packet.  A
      value of zero is valid.

   packet type (PT): 8 bits

      Contains the constant 200 to identify this as an RTCP SR packet.

   length: 16 bits

      The length of this RTCP packet in 32-bit words minus one,
      including the header and any padding.  (The offset of one makes
      zero a valid length and avoids a possible infinite loop in
      scanning a compound RTCP packet, while counting 32-bit words
      avoids a validity check for a multiple of 4.)

   SSRC of sender: 32 bits

      The synchronization source identifier for the originator of this
      SR packet.

   sender info: 160 bits

      Format defined in Section 6.4.1.1. The sender information, is 20
      octets long and is present in every sender report packet.  It
      summarizes the data transmissions from this sender.

   report blocks: variable

      Array consisting of zero or more reception report blocks (as
      defined in Section 6.4.1.2) depending on the number of other
      sources heard by this sender since the last report.  Each
      reception report block conveys statistics on the reception of RTP
      packets from a single synchronization source. Receivers SHOULD NOT
      carry over statistics when a source changes its SSRC identifier
      due to a collision.
