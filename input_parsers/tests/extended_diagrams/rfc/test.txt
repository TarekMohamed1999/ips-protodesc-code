5.3.1.  RTP Header Extension

   An extension mechanism is provided to allow individual
   implementations to experiment with new payload-format-independent
   functions that require additional information to be carried in the
   RTP data packet header.  This mechanism is designed so that the
   header extension may be ignored by other interoperating
   implementations that have not been extended.

   Note that this header extension is intended only for limited use.
   Most potential uses of this mechanism would be better done another
   way, using the methods described in the previous section.  For
   example, a profile-specific extension to the fixed header is less
   expensive to process because it is not conditional nor in a variable
   location.  Additional information required for a particular payload
   format SHOULD NOT use this header extension, but SHOULD be carried in
   the payload section of the packet.

   Only a single extension can be appended to the RTP data header.

      To allow multiple interoperating implementations to each
      experiment independently with different header extensions, or to
      allow a particular implementation to experiment with more than one
      type of header extension, the first 16 bits of the header
      extension are left open for distinguishing identifiers or
      parameters.  The format of these 16 bits is to be defined by the
      profile specification under which the implementations are
      operating.  This RTP specification does not define any header
      extensions itself.

   length: 16 bits

      The header extension contains a 16-bit length field that counts
      the number of 32-bit words in the extension, excluding the four-
      octet extension header (therefore zero is a valid length).
