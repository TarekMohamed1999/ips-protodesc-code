    <section number="1" title="Introduction">
      <t>This User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is defined to make available a datagram mode of packet-switched computer communication in the environment of an interconnected set of computer networks.  This protocol assumes that the Internet Protocol (IP) is used as the underlying protocol.</t>
      <t>This protocol provides a procedure for application programs to send messages to other programs with a minimum of protocol mechanism.  The protocol is transaction oriented, and delivery and duplicate protection are not guaranteed.  Applications requiring ordered reliable delivery of streams of data should use the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).</t>

      <t>A user interface should allow</t>

        <t>the creation of new receive ports,</t>
        <t>receive operations on the receive ports that return the data octets and an indication of source port and source address,</t>
        <t>and an operation that allows a datagram to be sent, specifying the data, source and destination ports and addresses to be sent.</t>

    <section number="4" title="IP Interface">
      <t>The UDP module must be able to determine the source and destination internet addresses and the protocol field from the internet header. One possible UDP/IP interface would return the whole internet datagram including all of the internet header in response to a receive operation.  Such an interface would also allow the UDP to pass a full internet datagram complete with header to the IP to send. The IP would verify certain fields for consistency and compute the internet header checksum.</t>
