          RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications

6. RTP Control Protocol -- RTCP

6.7 APP: Application-Defined RTCP Packet

   A APP packet is formatted as follows:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |V=2|P| subtype |   PT=APP=204  |             length            |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                           SSRC/CSRC                           |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                          name (ASCII)                         |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                   application-dependent data                ...
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The APP packet is intended for experimental use as new applications
   and new features are developed, without requiring packet type value
   registration.  APP packets with unrecognized names SHOULD be ignored.
   After testing and if wider use is justified, it is RECOMMENDED that
   each APP packet be redefined without the subtype and name fields and
   registered with IANA using an RTCP packet type.

   subtype: 5 bits

      May be used as a subtype to allow a set of APP packets to be
      defined under one unique name, or for any application-dependent
      data.

   packet type (PT): 8 bits

      Contains the constant 204 to identify this as an RTCP APP packet.

   name: 4 octets

      A name chosen by the person defining the set of APP packets to be
      unique with respect to other APP packets this application might
      receive.  The application creator might choose to use the
      application name, and then coordinate the allocation of subtype
      values to others who want to define new packet types for the
      application.  Alternatively, it is RECOMMENDED that others choose
      a name based on the entity they represent, then coordinate the use
      of the name within that entity.  The name is interpreted as a
      sequence of four ASCII characters, with uppercase and lowercase
      characters treated as distinct.

   application-dependent data: (length-2) words

      Application-dependent data may or may not appear in an APP packet.
      It is interpreted by the application and not RTP itself.  It MUST
      be a multiple of 32 bits long.
