                      UDP: User Datagram Protocol

1.  Introduction

   This User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is defined to make available a
   datagram mode of packet-switched computer communication in the
   environment of an interconnected set of computer networks.  This
   protocol assumes that the Internet Protocol (IP) is used as the
   underlying protocol.

   This protocol provides a procedure for application programs to send
   messages to other programs with a minimum of protocol mechanism.  The
   protocol is transaction oriented, and delivery and duplicate
   protection are not guaranteed.  Applications requiring ordered
   reliable delivery of streams of data should use the Transmission
   Control Protocol (TCP).

2.  Header Format

   A UDP packet is formatted as follows:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |          source port          |        destination port       |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |             length            |            checksum           |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                              data                           ...
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                   Figure 1: User Datagram Header Format

   source port [Port]

      Source Port is an optional field, when meaningful, it indicates
      the port of the sending process, and may be assumed to be the port
      to which a reply should be addressed in the absence of any other
      information.  If not used, a value of zero is inserted.

   destination port [Port]

      Destination Port has a meaning within the context of a particular
      internet destination address.

   length: 16 bits

      Length is the length in octets of this user datagram including
      this header and the data.  (This means the minimum value of the
      length is eight.)

   checksum: 16 bits

      Checksum is the 16-bit one's complement of the one's complement
      sum of a pseudo header of information from the IP header, the UDP
      header, and the data, padded with zero octets at the end (if
      necessary) to make a multiple of two octets.

      If the computed checksum is zero, it is transmitted as all ones
      (the equivalent in one's complement arithmetic).  An all zero
      transmitted checksum value means that the transmitter generated no
      checksum (for debugging or for higher level protocols that don't
      care).

   data: length*8-64 bits

      The payload of the UDP packet

3.  User Interface

   A user interface should allow

   o  the creation of new receive ports,

   o  receive operations on the receive ports that return the data
      octets and an indication of source port and source address,

   o  and an operation that allows a datagram to be sent, specifying the
      data, source and destination ports and addresses to be sent.

4.  IP Interface

   The UDP module must be able to determine the source and destination
   internet addresses and the protocol field from the internet header.
   One possible UDP/IP interface would return the whole internet
   datagram including all of the internet header in response to a
   receive operation.  Such an interface would also allow the UDP to
   pass a full internet datagram complete with header to the IP to send.
   The IP would verify certain fields for consistency and compute the
   internet header checksum.

5.  Protocol Application

   The major uses of this protocol is the Internet Name Server, and the
   Trivial File Transfer.

6.  Protocol Number

   This is protocol 17 (21 octal) when used in the Internet Protocol.
   Other protocol numbers are listed in.
